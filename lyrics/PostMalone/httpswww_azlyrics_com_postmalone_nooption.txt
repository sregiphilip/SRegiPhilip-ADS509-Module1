Post Malone - No Option Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Hoe, I look so clean and motherfuckers just talkin'
Show up at the spot and now everyone, they all watchin'
Don't wanna prove you wrong but shit, you leave me with no option, yeah, yeah
Everybody asking "Post, when is the album droppin'?"
Ever since the very first day at it, I been poppin'
Don't wanna prove you wrong but shit, you leave me with no option, yeah, yeah
Ooh, swingin' in a four-door
Now they takin' photos
Bottles, we need more of those, ooh
Say she bring it a little shorter
He be on the boarder
She always bring four rolls, oh yeah
Everything that I went for
Waited so long to get on
The Caddy just sits on the chrome
I swang through on dubs on the four
Baby wanna get in this S-Class
Lil' momma, she just wanna go fast
You know, baby, you don't get a free pass
So I told her "Ass, gas or grass"
Rolex with the diamonds keep me shining
Gotta have perfect timing when I'm riding
Brand new Aston Martin with no mileage, ooh, ooh, ooh yeah
Hoe, I'm so clean and motherfuckers just talkin'
Show up at the spot and now everyone, they all watchin'
Don't wanna prove you wrong but shit, you leave me with no option, yeah, yeah
Less you hoppin' in a old-school
Swimmin' in the car pool
Everything is all cool
And she told me not to tell
With the rumors that I heard
She said everything was all true
Baby, wanna get in this S-Class
Lil' momma, she just wanna go fast
You know, baby, you don't get a free pass
So I told her "Ass, gas or grass"
Rolex with the diamonds keep me shining
Gotta have perfect timing when I'm riding
Brand new Aston Martin with no mileage, ooh, ooh, ooh yeah
Just me and lil' momma, yeah
Ridin' around LA
Just me and lil' momma, yeah
We run the city, yeah
Baby, wanna get in this S-Class
Lil' momma, she just wanna go fast
You know, baby, you don't get a free pass
So I told her "Ass, gas or grass"
Rolex with the diamonds keep me shining
Gotta have perfect timing when I'm riding
Brand new Aston Martin with no mileage, oh oh
So come hop in that ooh
What do you wanna do?
Put that dime in my coupe
With that gold on my tooth, oh yeah
