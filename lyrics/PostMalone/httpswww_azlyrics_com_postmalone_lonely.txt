Post Malone - Lonely Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Oh... 
Oh... 
Oh... 
I just...
Can I...
I just...
I just, can I...
I just...
Can I...
I just, I just
Can I, I just
I just want to see you 
Something I can see through baby 
You make my dreams come true
Can I...
Can I , I just
I just
Baby can I come and see you
I just, I just
Girl you seem always on the move
Baby
I just cannot, uh, figure out what to do
And I just, I just, uh, cannot let you go on your own
Eh, why you got to be so inconsiderate wit' it
Know that you mean more than any one of these bitches
Its like you wanna see me go and hop off some bridges
Emo pussy woulda' gone and cut up ones wrists
Instead I'm going to drop a hundred bands on a whip
Only way I know to get my brain off of shit, eh
I just want to see you, maybe talk about shit
I just want to see ya, you might feel for the kid
It's you that I have been searchin' for
Just let me know what's good with y'all
Can't keep on going back and forth
Won't let you, won't let you
I just...
I just...
I just want to see you 
Something I can see through baby 
You're making my dreams come true 
Can I...
Can I...
Cause I just want to see you 
Something I can see through baby
You make my dreams come true 
I just, can I
I just...
I just...
Can I come and see you
I just, something I can see through baby, I just
Make my dreams come true 
You're walking alone, you're walking alone
I hate when you walk, at least talk on the phone
There's some creeps in this zone, you said joker shut up I should know how to walk
I come from the bronx, I said baby its cool you know I like your talk
We keepin' it cool, we keepin it, keep it
I just...
I just, I just want to see you 
Something I can see through baby 
You're making my dreams come true 
Can I...
Can I...
Cause I just want to see you 
Something I can see through baby
You make my dreams come true 
Imma' never be alone
Imma' never be alone
When you're walkin' down the road
