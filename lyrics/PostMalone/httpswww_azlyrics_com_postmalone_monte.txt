I feel like Monte, bitch I feel like Monte

Assist from Rondo, bitch I feel like Monte

Don't give no fucks no, bitch I feel like Monte
I just flew into town, fresh of the jetty
And then I Rondo my hoe I know she ready
Bitch I'mm sauce on them hoes, might spend some ready
And I just cut that hoe off like a machete
I'm a new 3 boy white boy braids
And I hit that shit good tell that pussy go away
She just want to come with me but that pussy ain't a no no way no way
Bitch I feel like Monte

I love them hoes that mean I feel like I'm Monta Ellis
Had to cut some niggas off cause they was jealous
