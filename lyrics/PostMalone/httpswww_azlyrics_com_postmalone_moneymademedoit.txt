Post Malone - Money Made Me Do It Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Diamonds in my chain gold
Every 20 minutes change clothes
I had a mil before the label
Just as long as they know, money made me do it
I said rest in peace to Bankroll
You in a better place dog
You won't ever see me lay low
Start the engine watch me take off, money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
Take a ride when we wake up
Hit the gas melt your face off
Spend the day counting cake up
With a dime who think I changed up
I took the Lincoln down Rodeo
Ran through it like some Drain-o
Lots of bags can't complain though
We was shopping until they closed
Why did I do that? Did I do that? Ooh yeah
New whip now I can pay my rent, ooh yeah
Diamonds in my chain gold
Every 20 minutes change clothes
I had a mil before the label
Just as long as they know, money made me do it
I said rest in peace to Bankroll
You in a better place dog
You won't ever see me lay low
Start the engine watch me take off, money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
Got a bandana round my neck
Like Bankroll Fresh
Pocket full of street money
Bout to count my blessing
One hundred, one thousand
100K, one million
We smoke, we lay up, we rap
We talked about a vision 
I got diamonds like a rainbow, every time I change clothes
Shawty fucked my friend but I act like I ain't know
I'ma buy a rain coat, the storm might approach you
Clown like your daddy met your mom at a circus
I do on purpose, do it for the neighborhood
Smoking on that Meagan Good, with my niggas when I do it
Got that leather and that wood, got the marble on the floor
Got the burglar bars on the door at the bando
Diamonds in my chain gold
Every 20 minutes change clothes
I had a mil before the label
Just as long as they know, money made me do it
I said rest in peace to Bankroll
You in a better place dog
You won't ever see me lay low
Start the engine watch me take off, money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
