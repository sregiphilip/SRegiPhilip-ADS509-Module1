Post Malone - Patient Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I know my wrist be dancin' crazy
Been on some fly shit lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's "Fuck you, pay me."
Can't let these motherfuckers faze me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my mama raised me
Don't mean to brag, but can you blame me?
200k and VVS, yellow diamonds
They wanna run up but they won't ever find me
I sleep right next to the F and N,
motherfuckers the government
Shut down all the plottin'
100 bands on my body
Fuck with them boys, touch your body
Lil mama just want my pockets
'Rari take off like a rocket
Hol' up, you too close
I don't know, I don't know ya'
Had to run it, run it up
How I roll, how I roll, ya'
It's like after you pop off
They all act like they know ya'
And Young Post be like Pablo
And they all love the blow, yeah
I know my wrist be dancin' crazy
Been on some fly shit lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's fuck you, pay me
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my mama raised me
Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?
200, swerving, dippin', dodge on the highway
You may contain me but you won't never stop me
On her way to my residence
Try message your boo again, she pullin' up probably
Yeah, strally inside of that Bentley
Yeah, come take it tat' on my belly
Yeah, people actin' too friendly man
They tryna get dividends, this shit is a problem
Yeah, you just be talkin' shit but ain't ever met me
DeChino fucked your bitch and now you resent me
I know them people but they don't represent me
Them wastemen, we're gonna make 'em all pay
They will never stop the plan
80 jumpin' off my hand
Rollie, rollie, rollie
Bust it open
Holy moly
I know my wrist be dancin' crazy
Been on some fly shit lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's fuck you, pay me
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my mama raised me
Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?
