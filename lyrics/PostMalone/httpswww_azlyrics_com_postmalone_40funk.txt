Post Malone - 40 Funk Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

40 got me funky
I popped a molly
Went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Kyrie Irving and bitch I'm scoring
Drank two 40's, my bitch is foreign
She got deported
Thousand ounces, this shit still popping
Ain't got no worries
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
I popped a molly, switching lanes
I'm a pull up in this bitche's Audi
Lean in sprite and gin in tonic
These bitches erotic
She just wanna get inside my motherfucking pocket
Another 40, I should stop it
Two thousand ounces of this shit will make you feel like vomit
But I don't mind it, I kinda like it
Young and wild
We killing shit, we live this shit
I ain't go to the school
They asking how I live like this
I did my shit, 19 this year
And I'm only getting older til' I'm in the dirt
How I hold a girl with two 40's all in my hand
But pull up on me, try me, you can catch the fade my man
You and your friends
40 got me funky
I popped a molly
Went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Kyrie Irving and bitch I'm scoring
Drank two 40's, my bitch is foreign
She got deported
Thousand ounces, this shit still popping
Ain't got no worries
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
Gimme the 40
So I can be cool, yeah
Pass me the molly, eh
I wanna them too, no
I can't get enough
Man, I'm popping them shits and I'm dropping them hits
The music the liquor that's why I exist
And the money, let's skip the obvious shit
Ain't living too long if I'm living like this
Early morning waking up with the sweats
Going through shit I ain't never forget
But nothing I do will I ever regret
I need me that cheque, I need me that chronic
I don't remember tell me what's my name?
Drinking, swerving in the other lane
Fuck a Zulu drinking acid rains
40 got me funky
I popped a molly
Went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Kyrie Irving and bitch I'm scoring
Drank two 40's, my bitch is foreign
She got deported
Thousand ounces, this shit still popping
Ain't got no worries
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
