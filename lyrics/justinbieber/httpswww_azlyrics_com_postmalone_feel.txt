Post Malone - Feel Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

She talkin' that noise, take her lovin' with the dawn, always talkin' on the phone
After we fuck in the morn' she wake up, she wearin' my clothes
She always be callin' my phone
She always be stealin' my clothes, yeah
Askin' me how does it feel when you know you could buy it at the store, yeah
Yeah, I'm bringin' that down to the floor
I'm droppin' the foreign in foreign
Hey, I came a long way on my own, ayy
I'm doin' this shit on my own, ayy
I don't give a fuck what I'm told, ayy
I came a long way on my own, ayy
Now her pussy made out of gold, ayy
I swear her pussy all in my soul, ayy
She got that soldier
Four days a hundred thousand
Forever like a diamond
She bring me back to life, yeah
I'm so fly I'm moshin'
Quit talkin' all that nonsense
I'm just tryna fuck you 'til you don't know nothin'
:]
I cross my t's and dot my i's yeah I'm for real 
He hold me down 
That's my shit 
He buy whatever, he know the drill 
Don't need no pill 
He whispered in my ear and told me feel, feel, feel, oh, oh, oh
He love that I say what I feel
He feel what I say 'cause it's real
You couldn't forget, I never changed up on my set
And I only make calls to collect, that's why we connect
We can go half on a jet, baby we on to the next
Fuck all the stress
Fuckin' with bitches who's new to the game when you got you a vet
I know you like it when I act like I'm still shy
Then turn around and put that thing in overdrive
I'm down to ride
I'ma keep you on my shoulder
'Cause every cold nigga need a bitch that's ten times colder
:]
I cross my t's and dot my i's yeah I'm for real 
He hold me down 
That's my shit 
He buy whatever, he know the drill 
Don't need no pill 
He whispered in my ear and told me feel, feel, feel, oh, oh, oh
Hey, fuck me 'til I can't see straight
Make me think that hoe was a mistake
I just need to feel you all the time
Ride hoe, ride hoe, alright, alright, alright
