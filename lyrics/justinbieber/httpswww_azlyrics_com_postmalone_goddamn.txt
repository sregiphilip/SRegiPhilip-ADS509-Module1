Post Malone - God Damn Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

God damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes cause that ass so dumb
Everyone here wanna hit that yum
Yeah, yeah, god damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes cause my ice so dumb
Everyone know 'bout my bread, got some
Yeah, yeah, god damn
Bustin' out the, hoo hey
I just keep on blastin' out the pussy and
God damn, bustin' out the, hoo hey
I just fucked my bitch, rockin' StÃ¼ssy, yeah
Ooh, drop em' all to keep my sauce
She really ain't shit, bitch, I dropped it all off
Hit the strip club and blow it all off top
Cause I will never love a damn hoe in my life
God damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes cause that ass so dumb
Everyone here wanna hit that yum
Yeah, yeah, god damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes cause my ice so dumb
Everyone know 'bout my bread, got some
Yeah, yeah, god damn
Okay, I pulled up, dropped the top
Everybody looking, wonder who I am
She get out, ass big
Everybody looking like, "God damn"
And she say she want a nigga who
Can handle everything with other men 
Then she topped me off and turned around
Said, "Take it daddy," so I went Super Saiyan
Flavor last forever, any bitches know you weak 
I'm so in love with making money that I can't sleep
Excuse me, sir, can I have my sauce back?
Trynna run off with my sauce, you need to bring it back
God damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes cause that ass so dumb
Everyone here wanna hit that yum
Yeah, yeah, god damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes cause my ice so dumb
Everyone know 'bout my bread, got some
Yeah, yeah, god
