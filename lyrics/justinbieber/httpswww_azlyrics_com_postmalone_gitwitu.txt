Post Malone - Git Wit U Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Said I wanna get with you, 
Lil mama bust a move, 
Said I wanna get with you, 
All these jewels, I'm just flossin'
Plainly on my boss shit
Bad bitch on my carpet
All white, I'm so on God shit
Hundred miles get caught shit
Off a pill, feel nauseous
Ain't babysittin' these bitches
I ain't Kevin Costner
No sayin' got her brain lit
Wanna fuck? I'm almost famous
She blow this thing, get faded
Lil mama say that I'm jaded
Maybe you saw that I'm payed up
Your man, he keep you so caged up
I won't tell who you stay with
That's on everyone that I came with
You know after we done I gotta roll
You know after we done I gotta go
Said I wanna get with you, 
Lil mama bust a move, 
Said I wanna get with you, 
I'm the fuckin' man
Jumpin' out the Benz
Every time you see
I post these hundreds in my pants
I'll do what he can't
Just wanna see you dance
Do something with that ass
Girl put something in my hands
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Don't be shy girl it's okay
Reload, fade, fade, fade, fade, fade
How much did you pay, pay, pay?
I'ma let you in my chain
Just might let you sip this 'pagne
Every single night the same
Lemme hear you say my name
Said I wanna get with you, 
Lil mama bust a move, 
Said I wanna get with you,
