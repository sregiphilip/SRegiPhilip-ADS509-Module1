Post Malone - Fuck Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

I just wanna fuck
I just wanna fuck
I just wanna fuck
I just wanna fuck
I ain't here for no conversation
I ain't really tryna talk
Can a nigga be honest baby? 
I just came here to fuck
Shawty take of them heels and your shirt
And that skirt and them panties right now
Baby step into my room, show me love
And get served like tennis right now
If you wanna come and get served right now
Then you know it's goddamn guaranteed to go down
I'm going down, you're going down
It's going down for sure
Baby girl sit down right now
Give you five seconds, one, two, three, four
I'mma turn your ass around, right now
Now you're screaming "Good Lord"
Got you smoking on the loud, knock you down
Fuck you like you never been before
I could fuck you all the tiiiiime
Girl I'm glad you're miiiiine
I ain't here for no conversation
I ain't really tryna talk
Can a nigga be honest baby? 
I just came here to fuck
Shawty take of them heels and your shirt
And that skirt and them panties right now
Baby step into my room, show me love
And get served like tennis right now
If you wanna come and get served right now
Then you know it's goddamn guaranteed to go down
Go down, hell yeah, I'mma say it
Go and show me what you working with
Give a fuck about the man that you rolling with
Think it's 'bout damn time that you done with him
How you get so bad? We all wonderin'
Lil mama look hotter than the summer is
I ain't gonna tell you lies like the other did
Baby girl, I'mma keep it one hundred
Get me on, I'mma, I'mma call you later
And these Saint Laurent's looking alligator
And maybe that's why she want an elevator
Elevate your life, elevate your life
Girl you know I wouldn't wanna wife ya
Girl I wouldn't wanna make you spiteful
Girl I wouldn't wanna mix your life up
Mix your life up...
Yeah I was tryna get her to my bed
But we ain't make it out the kitchen 
I was cooking and I burned the bacon, damn
Pussy got a nigga slippin', yeah
Got your boy going deep: breast stroke, back stroke
Girl I'm swimming right now 
Got her singing like me, when she moan
Let's make a song, and we're jamming right now
I could fuck you all the ti-i-i-i-i-i-i-ime
Girl I'm glad you're m-i-i-i-i-i-ine
