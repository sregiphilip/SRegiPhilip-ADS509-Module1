Post Malone - Oh God Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Oh God, oh God save me
No I ain't gonna die for my baby
20 dollars, keeping me eating
Might just eat the apple from the garden of Eden
The way she call my name, the way she call my name
The way she call my name, I pray I'll be the same
Oh God, oh God save me
No I ain't gonna die for my baby
Oh God, oh God save me
Ain't no love for the ones who betray me
Drop top, horses run, power steering
Drive like hell to get away from this feeling
The way she call my name, the way she call my name
Try take my soul away, yeah bitch make my day
Oh God, oh God save me
No I ain't gonna die for my baby
Oh God, oh God save me
Ain't no love for the ones who betray me
